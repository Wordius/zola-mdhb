first came across markdown in 2011. Since then the apps I have used include nvAlt, Byword, Ulysses and Bear. These are the apps I have used for any length of time. I have kicked the tyres of many others.\nUses have included writing for magazines, taking notes, editing books, journalling and creating websites. Most of these uses have been purely work related, but on occasion I did it just for fun.\nOften I had to export the articles as .rtf files to make them compatible with MS Word – an app the companies I worked for forced on their employees. I believe if any of the powers that be had known the full benefits of markdown they would have dumped MS Word in the trash without a second thought. But they weren’t good listeners.\nWill the markdown world ever become dominated by a single app, as MS Word became the word processor of the masses? I don’t think so. I quite enjoy the proliferation of apps available for markdown, and long may that continue. That said, it would be nice to see some consensus reached on the markdown standard itself.\nCurrently my markdown editor is Obsidian, which uses a combination of CommonMark, Github-flavoured markdown and LaTeX.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/about/","title":"About"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blockquotes-in-markdown/":{"body":"Blockquotes are more commonly known as ‘pullquotes’ or ‘callouts’ in the world of publishing.\nTo create a blockquote, add a greater than sign&nbsp;(&gt;)&nbsp;in front of a paragraph:\n\nThe rendered output will look something like this:\n\nThe wheels on the bus go round and round.\n\nBlockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs if you add a&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;on the blank lines between the paragraphs.\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nThe wheels on the bus go round and round.\nRound and round\nRound and round.\nThe wheels on the bus go round and round, all day long.\n\nFor compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.\nIf you want to explore other aspects of blockquotes, see the references for them in Obsidian, where they are, strangely enough, also referred to as callouts.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blockquotes-in-markdown/","title":"Blockquotes in markdown"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/","title":"Posts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/affine-alpha-on-way/":{"body":"\n    Affine Alpha is soon to be released\n    \nAffine describes itself as ‘a next-gen knowledge base and open-source alternative to Notion and Miro’, but access to the Alpha has yet to be released.\nAffine says:\n\nIn order to be able to carry more complex functions in future development while&nbsp;maintaining the stability of AFFiNE, our development team decided to refactor the project and&nbsp;standardise the code structure. The new version of AFFiNE Alpha will provide a more stable experience for users and a more organised structure for developers.\nSecondly, the refactoring also saw a lot of changes to the design of pages. To a certain extent, a good UI design solution makes the user experience more fluid. In previous versions, users have been confused by the design of the pages. Our product and design teams have held many meetings and long conversations about these issues and have come up with a more user-focussed design for AFFiNE Alpha. The aim is to give users&nbsp;a better visual effect and operating experience.\n\nThe advantages are:\n\nThis rebuilt AFFiNE will provide users with&nbsp;a smoother editing experience and a more stable system environment. We will ensure a more focused creative environment for our users.&nbsp;Markdown was also a key focus of this refactoring. We have improved the Markdown system and overcome some previous typographical issues. For the Markdown syntax system, we also consider how 'deletion' and 'secondary editing' can be implemented, while ensuring that the style is aesthetically pleasing.\nBy collating user feedback, we have also learnt that there is&nbsp;a strong demand for dark mode.\n\nMarkdown is quite easy to use, apparently:\n\nMarkdown presents a fast, efficient and standardized way to edit and format text. You can evoke your required text style directly through a specific identifier, without the need to select function keys with the mouse. This way of editing can greatly increase the speed of the user's work and allows them to focus on the content.\nMarkdown is actually quite simple to use, and in layman’s terms, you can also think of Markdown syntax as a shortcut. The following list shows the Markdown syntax supported by AFFiNE Alpha.\n\nFurther support planned:\n\nIn our previous release import/export features were limited to .affine files and in user feedback many users have commented that the import/export features need to be more flexible. As we continue to consider what formats to natively support, the current release boasts&nbsp;export support for both HTML and Markdown file types in this version. With greater support coming in future updates.\n\nThe major drawback of using Affine – for me anyway – is it’s reliance on AI. But that can be disabled. If you trust it, that is. I tested it on a bunch of past notes that were useless to me and did not contain anything personal:\nTo disable the AI function, go to:\n\nSettings &gt; Editor &gt; Affine AI and disable and reload\n\nWhile you’re at it, go to Settings &gt; About  AFFINE and disable Telemetry.

Among the changes are updates to the app’s AI assistant, API and MCP integrations, improvements to whiteboards, a dusting off of the code editor and collections, and an Android beta being made public.\nChief among the updates is that Craft’s AI assistant is no longer restricted to single documents; it can now access your entire space. Communicate with all your content, search across folders and draw insights from everything you have written. It is also available anywhere you might need it: documents, collections, calendar, tasks and the code editor.\nOn the web and in Windows, the assistant is available at the document level, with space-level capabilities yet to arrive.\nThe AI capability can be controlled per space, so if you don’t like AI having access to your notes, turn it off:\n\nGo to&nbsp;Home View\nSelect your&nbsp;Space name\nTap&nbsp;Settings &gt; Assistant\nToggle the&nbsp;Enable Assistant&nbsp;option.\n\nNote that this setting is&nbsp;not synced across devices&nbsp;or across users in a shared space. If you disable it on your Mac, it will still be enabled on your iPhone (until disabled there too). And if you&nbsp;delete and reinstall the app, especially after a full reset, this setting will&nbsp;revert to default, with the assistant enabled again.\nAPI and MCP connections allow you to build interactive tools, automate workflows or integrate with AI services like ChatGPT and Claude. Create apps using Lovable, Replit or Bolt, and sync Craft with AI assistants that can read and update your content.\nOffline access, major stability improvements and a new engine make whiteboards faster, more reliable and production-ready.\nThe code editor now has more character limits, with the introduction of natural line wrapping, live math rendering, instant language switching and smarter syntax highlighting. Themes now adapt to your document style for a more cohesive experience and there are no more disappearing code blocks.\nCollections now have a cleaner layout and a host of tweaks have made it smoother, faster and more intuitive.\nAndroid users now get a look-in with access to a beta version. In summer 2025, Craft introduced editing capabilities for the mobile web, now they have taken it a step further by making Craft available in the Google Play Store.\nCraft is currently available with a 40% discount for Black Friday.

Normally, a site generator, commonly known as a static site generator, involves downloading and installing some software. Then you have to configure it – templates, config files, etc. – adding your instructions and uploading the documents, whether directly or via GitHub or similar, to your server. Sounds like a bit of a pfaff to me.\nDocsify does away with most of this. Unlike a traditional static site generator, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it loads and parses your markdown files and displays them as a website.\nHere is how it works.\nThe install is quite straightforward. It is recommended to install&nbsp;docsify-cli&nbsp;globally, which helps to initialise and preview the website locally. Open Terminal, or your command line interface, and type:\n\nThen, if you want to write the documentation in the&nbsp;./docs&nbsp;subdirectory, use the&nbsp;init command.\n\nAfter the&nbsp;init&nbsp;is complete, you can see the following file list in the&nbsp;./docs&nbsp;subdirectory.\n\nindex.html&nbsp;is the entry file\nREADME.md&nbsp;is the homepage\n.nojekyll, which prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore.\n\nYou can update the documentation in&nbsp;./docs/README.md and, of course, you can add&nbsp;more pages. Then preview your site by running the local server with&nbsp;docsify serve and view it at&nbsp;http://localhost:3000.\n\nAnd this, or similar, is what you get. All I did was add an ‘About’ page and linked to it from the homepage (README.md).\n\n    Add any pages you want, link to them from the homepage and the default theme looks like this\n    \nYou can then&nbsp;deploy it on GitHub Pages, share your thoughts with your ‘team’, incorporate any changes they suggest, then upload it to the world.\nThere are many other things you can do with Docsify, such as adding a sidebar and changing themes.

You love the special sauce. You ask the chef for the recipe, and he looks at you like you just asked for his social security number.\n“It’s a trade secret,” he says, guarding the vat of mayo with his life.\nThat is Proprietary Software…\n\nFSNotes, on the other hand, is open source software. The code is freely available for anyone to fork it or contribute their bit. Yes, it sells apps through the Mac and iOS app stores, but this is simply a means of supporting further development. Pocket money, in other words, so its developer, Ukrainian Oleksandr Hlushchenko, can work on and improve the software.\nWhen I first installed FSNotes, I thought there’s something familiar about the way this app works. It took me back to 2011 and nvALT, the first markdown editor I came across and, subsequently, used. Then I read the notes and all became clear. Many of the shortcut keys are based on Notational Velocity, a predecessor of nvALT.\nFor instance, one way to create a new note is to simply start typing its title in the search and create field, just as in nvALT. If the title isn’t already present, hit return and it creates a new note. Of course, the other way to create a new document is to use ⌘-N, as most apps do.\nWords are emphasised but the syntax remains, so **bold**, for example, keeps its asterisks, although they are greyed out so they kind of fade away. That’s an improvement on nvALT, where the asterisks stay and the word isn’t bolded.\nI can’t help thinking, though, that there should be some other way to distinguish headings from body text. Maybe giving the headings different colours would help, or even using some kind of scaled size so that # Heading 1 is twice the base font size, right down to # Heading 6, which is the same as the base font size.\n\n    FSNotes displays the markdown syntax by greying it out rather than hiding it\n    \nThe headings become clearer when you the check the note’s preview. Command-/ is the shortcut key in case you were wondering.\n\n    FSNotes in preview mode, accessible with the shortcut ⌘-/\n    \nFSNotes works best if you have your tagging in order. Many people don’t including me, preferring the old way of having a distinct set of folders. The app does not recognise subfolders, nor does the developer have any plans to recognise them.\nThere’s currently no official way to add a journal, but I can think of many ways of adding a basic journal by adopting a common tag. It may not be as refined as some apps out there, but it gets the job done and, more importantly, keeps your notes in plain text.\nTodos get their own section in the sidebar. You add a todo by pressing ⌘-0 (that’s zero, not ‘O’) or you can stick with the markdown syntax for tasks. This involves typing - [ ] and adding an ‘x’ in between the brackets once you have completed a task. The - [x]adds strikethrough to that particular task to show it’s complete.\nAdditional features include maths equations – implemented with MathJax – tables, footnotes, fenced code blocks, graphs, Git integration and security, which enables you to ‘autolock’ encrypted notes.\nThere is also support for the Textbundle format, which brings convenience by bundling your markdown text and all referenced images into a single file. Supported applications can exchange TextBundles without asking for additional permissions.\nFSNotes syncs with iCloud and, again, there is no sign that Dropbox, WebDAV or Google Drive sync will be added in the future.\nFSNotes is currently on version 6, with version 7 on the horizon. On social media, the developer said: “FSNotes 7 for macOS and iOS will be released simultaneously. The main focus [will be] on performance and modern design. The preliminary release date is December-January, provided that everything goes well in Kharkiv.”\nI, for one, can’t wait to see what Hluschenko has up his sleeve.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/fsnotes-brings-back-memories/","title":"FSNotes brings back memories.

But I have edited enough books in my time – at that time I edited most books in Ulysses – to know a good apple when I see one. I only stopped using Ulysses when it introduced its subscription model. And, coincidentally, I stopped editing books.\nFor me, it was always a toss up between Ulysses and Scrivener, which I always saw as the plodding giant of the book writing world. But I always found Scrivener to be far too complex for my needs. With Ulysses I could get right down to the job at hand; with Scrivener I was always scrambling around searching for a way to add side notes or research that didn’t go into the final edit. As a result, Scrivener became a ‘nice to have’ app, while Ulysses became the ‘nice to use’ app.\nNow, with its latest update, Ulysses rams that home. When the developers say this is a ‘major update’, they mean it.\nThe app has been updated across the board, including: the library, dashboard, quick open, toolbars, buttons, popovers for images, links and annotations:\n.\n\nResize the dashboard (Mac and iPad).\nYou can have the sheet list and dashboard open (iPad).\nThe editor now has a large bottom inset, so the transitions from reading to editing and back are much smoother, especially when using the onscreen keyboard.\nYou can now create new sheets from the Library (iPhone); these will either end up in your main Inbox or in ‘Project › Extras › Pending’.\nThe iPhone on-screen keyboard gained a prominent close button.\n\nOn the menus for macOS, they have:\n\nReworked both the main menu and many context menus.\nTypewriter Mode is gone; you can now activate the line marker or fixed scrolling or leave it off.\nThe Markup Bar is now either on or off (there’s no more ‘automatic’ choice).\nYou can now auto-hide the toolbar in full screen.\nYou can now select themes from the View menu.\nMarkup menus for paragraph and text are now available via the editor context menu.\n\nAnd Revision Mode is now just another tab&nbsp;in macOS:\n\nAdvanced text check, known as Revision Mode, has been moved into the main dashboard.\nYou now simply activate the tab to initiate a check and the check will continue if you switch to another sheet.\nTo end the check, just deselect the tab.\n\nThe list goes on, with changes to the Editor Focus, gestures, swipe and navigation, import and themes, with the ability to copy text for use in Substack and Basecamp thrown in.\nGive Ulysses a try.

It is used by writers, documentation creators, bloggers, mathematicians, scientists, project managers, task managers, and journal keepers. It is probably being used by someone sitting near to you.\nIt’s uses are wide, and it is spreading. LibreOffice, a free and private office suite of applications, has recently been adopted by the Austrian military to replace its reliance on Microsoft. LibreOffice has plans to introduce markdown.\nMarkdown is a simple way of formatting text. When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you are formatting it. Markdown – as originally planned – was a set of rules, or syntax, that formatted text for web pages. It is still used for that purpose today, but it has also been adopted by the writing community to suit their needs. That is, to make it easier to write without the need to reach for the mouse every couple of minutes to format some text.\nTo format text on web pages, people use Hypertext Markup Language, better known as HTML. But HTML can be complex, with&nbsp;numerous tags,&nbsp;such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;, not forgetting the accompanying closing tags as well: &lt;/div&gt;, &lt;/menu&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt;. Computers have no trouble reading these because they follow the syntax, but the tags make it difficult for humans to read HTML, so it’s not user friendly.\nMarkdown was created by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004. The original syntax for markdown is on Gruber’s website, Daring Fireball.\nBut, there’s more to markdown than HTML. With built-in parsers, or readers, it can be used to generate stunning presentations (IA Presenter) and beautiful, readable documentation, fit to grace any boardroom.\nWriting in markdown\nYou can create markdown files using:\n\nA basic text editor, such as Notepad, TextEdit or VS Code\nDedicated markdown editors for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android\nWeb-based markdown editors such as Dillinger or StackEdit.\n\nMarkdown files typically use the .md or .markdown extension.\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plain text documents. It has become one of the most widely used mark-up languages in the world.\nUnlike WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Word, markdown requires you to insert formatting syntax directly into the text. For example:\n\n# Heading One creates a heading\n**bold text** produces bold text.\n\nMarkdown syntax is intentionally simple and readable, even without rendering. This design allows markdown documents to be easily understood in their raw, plain text form. Not all markdown editors, such as nvALT, provide a real-time preview, but most editors have this facility.\nWhy use markdown?\nThere is no need to frequently reach for the mouse to format text, allowing you to maintain your train of thought. Writers can focus on creating content without being distracted by formatting issues. Compared to traditional WYSIWYG editors, such as Microsoft Word, markdown enables you to:\n\nKeep both hands on the keyboard for a greater level of efficiency\nQuickly format the text you produce with simple mark-up symbols\nAnd avoid complex menu operations and formatting settings.\n\nBenefitDescription\nVersatileUsed for websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, emails and technical documentation.\nPortableWorks across different applications without locking you into proprietary formats.\nPlatform-independentCan be written and viewed on any device or operating system.\nFuture-proofMarkdown files remain readable as plain text, ensuring long-term accessibility.\nUbiquitousSupported across major platforms like GitHub, Reddit and various editors.\n\nLess of a learning curve\nCompared to mark-up languages, such as HTML, markdown syntax is simple, with most people able to master the basics in under an hour.\nFor instance, the most common mark-up symbols number fewer than ten:\n\n#&nbsp;for headings\n*&nbsp;for emphasis or lists\n&gt; for blockquotes or quotes\n[]()&nbsp;for links\n![]()&nbsp;for images.\n\nThe markdown process\nMarkdown documents are typically converted into HTML or other formats for viewing or publishing. This process involves four main steps:\n\nCreate a markdown file using a text editor or your favourite markdown application.\nOpen the file in a markdown app.\nConvert the markdown content to HTML or another format (e.g. PDF, RTF).\nView or publish the formatted output.\n\nNote that the markdown application and processor (or parser) are distinct components, though many tools bundle both together.\nCompatibility\nMost text editors, code editors and note-taking apps support markdown. That makes it flexible. If you want to change from using one markdown editor to another – no problem. Simply move or copy across the files and start typing away.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/how-to-write-in-markdown/","title":"Start here"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/images-in-markdown/":{"body":"To include an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets and the path or URL to the image in parentheses.

The app you choose as your text editor will determine what flavour you are using. Never worry which flavour that is if you have found something that suits the way you work.\nThere are far too many flavours, or variants, of markdown to mention here. So I will only mention four: the original spec, Multimarkdown, Commonmark and Github-flavoured markdown.\nThis GitHub page has a more complete list if you’re interested in finding out more, but note that many of the versions listed are tailored to specific apps or platforms.\nMarkdown – the original\nMarkdown became a thing back in 2004, when John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz wrote the first specification.\nPut simply, markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool originally designed for web writers. It allows you to write in an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML if that is your intention.\nSo, with that said, markdown is two things:\n\na plain text formatting syntax; and\na software tool that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the&nbsp;syntax&nbsp;page on John Gruber’s site for details.\n\nSeveral&nbsp;variants have been developed since to adapt markdown&nbsp;to different platforms. Often these variants&nbsp;are referred to as flavours. Some of the main variants are Commonmark and GitHub-flavoured markdown, or GFM.\nThese variants extend the original standard&nbsp;set for markdown.\nMultimarkdown\nMultimarkdown – mentioned here because it was one of the earliest variants –&nbsp;is an extension of markdown that adds a number of features to create more complex documents, such as academic papers and books. It was developed by Fletcher Penney.\nThe main features of Multimarkdown are its support for metadata, footnotes and references, and mathematical formulas and equations.\nCommonmark\nCommonmark&nbsp;is a markdown specification developed to address the lack of standardisation and consistency in existing markdown implementations. Its goal is to provide a unified and clear definition of the language, ensuring that content is interpreted consistently across different platforms and applications.\nThe main features of Commonmark are a detailed and standardised specification that defines how Markdown should behave in various situations, offering a a solid foundation for the development of additional extensions and variants and ensuring that content is displayed consistently across different implementations.\nAs a result, Commonmark allows the addition of extensions to cover additional functionalities without breaking the basic specification.\nCommonmark is one of the specifications used in Obsidian.\nGitHub-flavoured markdown, or GFM\nGitHub-flavoured markdown&nbsp;is the variant that is used on GitHub to format README files, comments and other content. The main features of GFM, include the creation of tasks and checklists, tables and footnotes.\nGFM is also used in Obsidian.\nObsidian\nObsidian supports Commonmark, Github-flavoured markdown and LaTeX, the latter being a typesetting system designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation.\nSee the cheat sheet for more on how to get started with markdown.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/markdown-flavours/","title":"Flavours of markdown"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/markdown-use-cases/":{"body":"Markdown is:\n\nSimple: easy to learn and read.\nPortable: works anywhere, on any platform.\nPowerful: scales from notes to full documentation sites.\nExtensible: supported by countless tools and frameworks.\n\nWhether you’re taking notes, writing books or documenting software, markdown provides a universal, future-proof format. Markdown has many practical uses. Among them are:\nWebsites and documentation\nMarkdown is ideal for creating static or CMS-based websites.\n\nSimple hosting: Blot.im allows you to publish markdown files directly from Dropbox.\nStatic site generators: tools like Astro, Hugo and Zola (as used by this site) convert markdown to full websites (see Jamstack for more examples).\nCMS integration: platforms like Ghost and WordPress support markdown natively or via plugins, although, in my experience, WordPress’s integration was sketchy to say the least. Maybe things have improved since that time.\n\nIt is also widely used for technical documentation, with tools such as:\n\nMkDocs: a simple static site generator with themes.\nRead the Docs: automatically builds docs from markdown in GitHub repositories.\nVuePress: a Vue-powered documentation site builder.\n\nDocuments and notes\nMarkdown is suited to writing basic documents such as letters, essays and reports. It can be used on any platform, where you can export markdown to PDF or HTML using applications such as:\n\nMac: Obsidian, Bear\nWindows: Markdown Monster, ghostwriter\nLinux: ReText, ghostwriter\nWeb: Dillinger, StackEdit.\n\nIt is also popular for note-taking, with tools including:\n\nSimplenote: minimalist, cross-platform note app\nJoplin: a privacy-focused, open-source alternative\nVisual Studio Code: a developer-oriented note app.\n\nBooks\nMarkdown is commonly used for writing and self-publishing. Leanpub converts markdown into eBooks (PDF, EPUB, MOBI) and the generated PDFs can also be used for print publishing.\nPresentations\nYou can generate presentation slides from markdown using tools such as:\n\nMarp: an open-source presentation ecosystem\nCleaver: billed as a 30-second slide show for hackers\nDeckset (macOS)\nHyperdeck: a Mac and iPad app.\nIA Presenter: a cross-platform app.\n\nCollaboration\nMany collaboration tools support basic markdown formatting for text emphasis and structure, such as Slack, Discord and Wiki.js.\nFlavours of markdown\nDifferent tools implement markdown slightly differently. These variations are known as flavours.
