Back in the early 2000s, while I was toying with Joomla and setting up sites in WordPress I had no idea this other world existed. But, hidden behind the scenes in plain slight, was the static site generator. Yes, the world of static site generators has been around a while, since the mid 2000s according to some.

The most comprehensive list of SSGs I have come across can be found at [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). But here’s a short list of SSGs to get you going.

If you’re new to this or have limited to no knowledge of the various languages and template languages employed below, don’t fret. Most of the platforms mentioned 
work out of the box. If you want to extend them, then you may have some learning to do. That’s what the ‘Docs’ are for.
