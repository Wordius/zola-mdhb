I first came across markdown in 2011. Since then the apps I have used include [nvAlt](https://download.macupdate.com/app/mac/36277/nvalt/download), [Byword](https://www.bywordapp.com), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) and [Bear](https://bear.app). These are the apps I have used for any length of time. I have kicked the tyres of many others.

Uses have included writing for magazines, taking notes, editing books, journalling and creating websites. Most of these uses have been purely work related, but on occasion I did it just for fun.

Often I had to export the articles as `.rtf` files to make them compatible with MS Word – an app the companies I worked for forced on their employees. I believe if any of the powers that be had known the full benefits of markdown they would have dumped MS Word in the trash without a second thought. But they weren’t good listeners.

Will the markdown world ever become dominated by a single app, as MS Word became the word processor of the masses? I don’t think so. I quite enjoy the proliferation of apps available for markdown, and long may that continue. That said, it would be nice to see some consensus reached on the markdown standard itself.

Currently my markdown editor is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which uses a combination of CommonMark, Github-flavoured markdown and LaTeX.
