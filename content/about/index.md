I first came across markdown in 2011. Since then the apps I have used include [nvAlt](https://example.com), Byword, Ulysses and Bear. These are the apps I have used for any length of time.

Their uses have included writing for magazines, taking notes, editing books and creating websites – many of which have never made it live. Other than creating websites these uses have always been purely work related. 

Currently I’m using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
