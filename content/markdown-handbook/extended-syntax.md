Here are some of the features that may or may not be enabled by the markdown editor you end up using. Thatâ€™s down to the individual developer.

Obsidian, for instance, takes a different approach when it comes to `Heading IDs`. If you want to link to a `Heading ID` in Obsidian you type the following:

```Obsidian
[[#custom-id]]
```

Alternatively, you add a plugin, such as the [Table of Contents plugin](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/obsidian-plugin-toc), and that takes care of adding Heading IDs for you.

I have written a number of posts explaining some of these items in more detail. These are linked to below.
