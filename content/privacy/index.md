No legalese here. I am not a solicitor (read lawyer), nor am I involved in the legal profession in any other way. 

## Your data

All I want to know is roughly how many people look at this website and what interests them, because that interests me. There is nothing else. There are no secret police nor are there any spies lurking in the shadows, though you can never be too careful these days. 

## Web fonts

I use web fonts. All font files are served from this domain and there is no third party involved. If you have web fonts turned off, it does not load that stylesheet or the corresponding files, which should save you some bandwidth but not much. I think this site looks better with them, but you may see things differently.

## Links

You may occasionally come across links to Amazon and elsewhere. These may be affiliate links, they may not. Affiliate links help cover the costs of maintaining this site. Only help, mind you.

## Email

Emails are kept private, especially when sent encrypted, but I may want to quote something you have written on occasion. If that happens, I’ll ask you. If you have emailed me about something you think I got wrong, I will ask if it’s okay to use your name to credit the correction. If you do contact me by email, add me to your contacts to avoid the inevitable junk issues. 

I take your privacy and confidentiality seriously. If you have any comments, see my [contact page](/contact) for how to get in touch.
