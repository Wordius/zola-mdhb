[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), the app for macOS that boosts efficiency with hotkeys, keywords, text expansion and more, has a [*Lorem Ipsum* workflow](https://alfred.app/workflows/alexchantastic/lorem-ipsum/) for those occasions when you simply need some filler text, whether that’s for development or to try out a new font.

The workflow has a range of options for you to choose from:

- Characters
- Words
- Sentences
- Paragraphs.

Open Alfred and type `lipsum` followed by a space and a number to designate how many characters, words, sentences or paragraphs you want and the workflow generates the required text and pastes it into the frontmost app. If no app is accessible it copies the text to the clipboard for you to paste it where you want.

For instance, typing `Lipsum 5` then selecting the paragraphs option will generate five paragraphs of *Lorem Ipsum*.
