Some notes from the latest release of [Orsn](https://orsn.io/v2/), the electronic research notebook for writing up research findings:

- The new default editor is now a WYSIWYG text editor with various keyboard-driven menu options. 
- Under the hood the editor creates plain text markdown, but it’s easy to use if you’re not familiar with the markdown format. It’s even possible to enter markdown syntax directly into the WYSIWYG editor: elements like headings and checkboxes are rendered automatically.
- There is also a markdown mode, with optional splitscreen preview, for editing in markdown format directly.

Orsn remains a work in progress, with lots more to come, according to its creator Mike Kelly.
