An occasional post from The Markown Handbook.

Among today’s links, there is a text editor designed to work with markdown, JSON, YAML and TOML, a new iPad app with a mathematical leaning and markdown editor Tangent Notes’ latest update, a major one.

- The developer says [Ferrite](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite) is a fast, lightweight text editor for markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. It is built with Rust and egui for a native, responsive experience. The project is 100% AI-generated code, with all Rust code, documentation and configuration written by Claude via Cursor with MCP tools. 
- A TestFlight beta of [Archimedes for iPad](https://testflight.apple.com/join/fN2pFYhp), a native markdown and LaTeX editor optimised for mathematical writing, is now available with support for Liquid Glass, the menu bar and improved windowing. 
- [Tangent Notes](https://www.tangentnotes.com) v0.12.0-alpha.1 has been released. This is a major update, with a host of changes to underlaying frameworks. The details panel is now universal, allowing folders, images, etc. to show backlinks in addition to notes. There has also been a significant improvement in keyboard control, with lenses, pane settings, the details panel and the sidebar all easily navigated with the keyboard.
