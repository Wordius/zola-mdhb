Craft, the notes app with access to tasks, a built-in calendar, whiteboards and daily notes, has released a major update this Thanksgiving. Among the changes are updates to the app’s AI assistant, API and MCP integrations, improvements to whiteboards, a dusting off of the code editor and collections, and an Android beta being made public.

Chief among the updates is that Craft’s AI assistant is no longer restricted to single documents; it can now access your entire space. Communicate with all your content, search across folders and draw insights from everything you have written. It is also available anywhere you might need it: documents, collections, calendar, tasks and the code editor.

On the web and in Windows, the assistant is available at the document level, with space-level capabilities yet to arrive.

The AI capability can be controlled per space, so if you don’t like AI having access to your notes, turn it off:

1. Go to `Home View`
2. Select your `Space name`
3. Tap `Settings > Assistant`
4. Toggle the `Enable Assistant` option.

Note that this setting is not synced across devices or across users in a shared space. If you disable it on your Mac, it will still be enabled on your iPhone (until disabled there too). And if you delete and reinstall the app, especially after a full reset, this setting will revert to default, with the assistant enabled again.

API and MCP connections allow you to build interactive tools, automate workflows or integrate with AI services like ChatGPT and Claude. Create apps using Lovable, Replit or Bolt, and sync Craft with AI assistants that can read and update your content.

Offline access, major stability improvements and a new engine make whiteboards faster, more reliable and production-ready.

The code editor now has more character limits, with the introduction of natural line wrapping, live math rendering, instant language switching and smarter syntax highlighting. Themes now adapt to your document style for a more cohesive experience and there are no more disappearing code blocks.

Collections now have a cleaner layout and a host of tweaks have made it smoother, faster and more intuitive.

Android users now get a look-in with access to a beta version. In summer 2025, Craft introduced editing capabilities for the mobile web, now they have taken it a step further by making Craft available in the Google Play Store.
