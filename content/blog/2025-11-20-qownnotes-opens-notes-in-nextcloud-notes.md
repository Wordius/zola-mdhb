The latest version (v 25.11.1) of the open-source plain text editor [QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org) now allows you to open a note in Nextcloud Notes via the context menu in the note list if Nextcloud support is enabled.

Note that this only works if the Nextcloud Notes app is installed and configured properly and both QOwnNotes and Nextcloud Notes use the same notes path.

For this release, developer Patrizio Bekerle has also added more Spanish and Korean translations.
