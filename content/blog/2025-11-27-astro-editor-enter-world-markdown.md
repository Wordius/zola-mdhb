In a world literally teeming with markdown editors, enter [Astro Editor](https://astroeditor.danny.is), a niche editor with a very niche audience; that is, anyone who uses [Astro](https://astro.build) as a static site generator. V5+ users need apply only.

Astro Editor creator [Danny Smith](https://mastodon.social/@dannysmith@indieweb.social) has his reasons. He said:

> “Code editors are terrible for prose. iA Writer is great for prose but can’t handle frontmatter, MDX or component insertion.”

Astro Editor is the result, a free macOS app for writing markdown – its frontmatter – and MDX in Astro content collections.

Features include focus mode, copyedit highlighting, MDX component insertion, smart image insertion and a dark interface.

To use, simply point to any Astro 5+ project with content collections (the schemas are read from your `content.config.ts` automatically) and write: frontmatter fields become smart forms and YAML stays hidden, allowing you to focus purely on your content.

Use your code editor for, well, code, Terminal for git and Astro Editor for writing – each tool to its own.
