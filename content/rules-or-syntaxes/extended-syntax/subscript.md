description = "A subscript is a distinguishing character or symbol written directly beneath or next to and slightly below a letter or number"

Use a single tilde (`~`) before and after the characters:

```markdown
H~2~O
```

Which renders as:

H<sub>2</sub>O

Alternatively, use HTML:

```html
H<sub>2</sub>O
```
