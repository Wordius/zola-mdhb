Task lists (or checklists) create interactive checkboxes in supported applications. They use the following syntax:

```markdown
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media
```

Which renders as:

* [x] Write the press release
* [ ] Update the website
* [ ] Contact the media
