You can add emphasis by making text **bold** or *italic*, or ***bold italic***.

### Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. 

```markdown
**bold**
```

Which renders as:

**bold**

### Italic

To italicise text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

```markdown
*italics*
```

Which renders as:

*italics*

### Bold and italic

To emphasise text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase

```markdown
***bold italic*** or ___bold italic___
```

Which renders as:

***bold italic*** or ___bold italic___

Note that the latter does not work in a number of markdown editors, including Obsidian.
