To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`` ` ``). An example of how to do this is shown below:

```markdown
`html`
```

Which renders as:

`html`

## Code blocks

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

```
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
</html>
```

To create code blocks without indenting lines, seeÂ [fenced code blocks](http://127.0.0.1:1027/rules-or-syntaxes/extended-syntax/fenced-code-blocks).
