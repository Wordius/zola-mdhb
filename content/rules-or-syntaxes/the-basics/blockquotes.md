Blockquotes are more commonly known as ‘pullquotes’ or ‘callouts’ in the world of publishing. 

To create a blockquote, add a greater than sign (`>`) in front of a paragraph:

```markdown
> The wheels on the bus go round and round.
```

The rendered output will look something like this:

> The wheels on the bus go round and round.

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs if you add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```markdown
> The wheels on the bus go round and round.
>
> Round and round  
>
> Round and round.  
> 
> The wheels on the bus go round and round, all day long.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> The wheels on the bus go round and round.
>
> Round and round  
>
> Round and round.  
> 
> The wheels on the bus go round and round, all day long.

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes. 

If you want to explore other aspects of blockquotes, see the references for them in [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Quotes), where they are, strangely enough, also referred to as [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/callouts).
